# Haxe Examples

> "Haxe is an open source toolkit based on a modern, high level, strictly typed programming language, a cross-compiler, a complete cross-platform standard library and ways to access each platform's native capabilities."

-- [Official Haxe website](http://haxe.org)

Haxe can do a great many things. So many, in fact, that every once in a while you might find yourself in uncharted territory.

The community of Haxe users is slowly growing, and with it grows a need for _resources_. The [official manual](http://haxe.org/manual/introduction.html) provides a necessary detailed look at toolkit fundamentals, but it cannot answer every question. _And it shouldn't_.

This repository is a collection of examples modelled around users' (in)frequently asked questions. That is, questions I have frequently been asked or witnessed being asked.

Every example folder contains a readme file. This file introduces the concept being covered by the example, describes the example itself, provides instructions for building, and lists references for further studies.

You are welcome to request examples by submitting issues, or provide your own examples by submitting pull requests.
